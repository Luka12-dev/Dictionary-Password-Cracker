How to Use the 🔓Dictionary Password Cracker App
1. Launch the application
Run the program (Python file).

A window will open with a password input field, two buttons, and a status display area.

2. Enter the password to test
In the field labeled "Enter password (for test):", type the password you want the app to try to find.

3. Load the wordlist file
Click the 📂Load Wordlist button.

Select a text file (.txt) containing a list of possible passwords, one word per line (for example, wordlist.txt).

The app will notify you that the wordlist was successfully loaded.

4. Start the attack
Click the 🚀Start Attack button.

The app will begin checking each word from the wordlist to see if it matches the entered password.

You will see the current attempt number and the word being tested displayed at the bottom.

5. Result
If the password is found in the wordlist, a message will appear:
✅Password found: [your password].

If the password is not in the wordlist, the app will notify you accordingly (if you add that feature).
